# Hood-Data-Science-Portfolio
This repository contains all the assignments and projects I completed for the Introduction to Data Science class. It can be viewed as a repository that I will continue to update throughout the semester to show my progress in working effectively with data, developing simple applications, and communicating results in visualizations.

The assignments and projects in the repository revolve around the fundamental aspects of a data scientist, including working effectively with data, carrying out simple visualizations, and using interactive tools to explore the data. The assignments and projects are organized in separate folders, each including the code, data files, and a written explanation of the project and the purpose of the work.

# Organization Plan

The projects in the repository include a brief write-up that describes the purpose of the project, as well as visualizations such as tables, charts, and graphs to illustrate the results, and sometimes interactive elements to enable the reader to explore the results.
